		<h2>Colaboration & Innovation</h2>
		<p>The Inventrepreneurship (invention + entrepreneurship) Studio will be both a teaching and research initiative. This will include a weekly "Solutions Studio" to bring together doctors, engineers, entrepreneurs, medical students, engineering students, and business students, to solve some of the world's most challenging health and well-being problems. HII will also create innovative teaching programs and leverage talent across existing programs (Rotman MBA, Computer Science MScAC, TRP, Inventrepreneurship) at the convergence of the fields of engineering, medicine, and business, as well as provide ventures to feed into CDL, H2i, and other incubators, amplifying these initiatives.</p>
