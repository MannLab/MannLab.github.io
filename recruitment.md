# Student-First Authentic Mentorship at MannLab
*From Steve Mann:*

We run MannLab in Silicon Valley, Shenzhen, and Toronto, using the MIT method. Student success is the first priority. I'd like to see at least one of you in each cohort get into MIT (my alma mater), and at least one of you get into Stanford (where I also spent much of my time), or at least one of you co-found a successful startup with a more than $100,000,000 raise.

That's our goal. Details like schedules, time, etc., matter less than that goal. The best success comes, not from careful planning (akin to classical music), but from improvisational "jamming" (akin to jazz music). [See this page](/news) for examples of past success, and there are dozens more. 

Many of the people you'll meet in our lab are best-in-the-world at what they do. Show us what youâ€™re best at in the application below:
