While transitioning from MaSc. to PhD under Mann's supervision, Mir Adnan Ali founded a blockchain company and raised $31,000,000 by ICO (Initial Coin Offering). Ali and Mann invented the concept of blockchain-sousveillance. Sousveillance is the "Little Data" ("Little Watching") counterpart to the otherwise one-sided "Big Data" ("Big Watching") of surveillance. See "FreeGlass...", Mann, Ali, Lo, and Wo, in IEEE i-Society.
