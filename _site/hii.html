        <h2 id="empowering-people-through-wearables-and-technology-thats-part-of-us">Empowering People Through Wearables and Technology That’s “Part of Us”</h2>

<h3 id="problem-statements-and-objectives">Problem Statements and Objectives:</h3>
<p>(i) Human-centred design philosophy considers humans as users of technology, not
humans and technologies as mutual extensions of one-another.
Technology should improve our health and well-being by providing continuous
sensing and feedback when we want. It should function as a Natural User-Interface.
(ii) Technology is often opaque, closed-source, offering little feedback with regards
to the handling of personal data we provide through use. This raises questions about
the integrity of a device’s allegiance, security, and the true protection of our privacy,
identity, and freedom. These concerns are amplified immensely as we integrate
more closely with technology (immersive, wearable, implantable, etc.). 
Technology should, when we desire, be transparent by providing us with feedback
on what happens to our data, how it is or was used, if and how it is breached, by
who, etc., and technology should be subject to audit by us if we wish (ie. open
source).
—</p>

<p><em>Wearable AI, Embodied AI, and Humanistic Intelligence (HI) embody an
information-processing apparatus inextricably intertwined with the natural
capabilities of our human mind and body. Rather than trying to emulate human
intelligence, HI recognizes that the human brain is perhaps the best neural network
of its kind. Devices that embody HI are worn (or borne, or carried) continuously
during all facets of ordinary day-to-day living. Through long-term adaptation they
begin to function as true extensions of the mind and body.</em></p>

<h2 id="empowerment-themes-a-wearables-b-society-and-c-the-environment">Empowerment Themes: (A) Wearables, (B) Society, and (C) the Environment:</h2>
<p>Our initiative considers: (A) wearables and other human-extending technologies that
become part of us; (B) the crucial relationship that exists between this
human-machine entity (“cyborg”) and other “cyborgs” (“smart society”); and (C) the
relationship between human-machine entities and the world around them
(environment, i.e. “cyborgs” in “smart buildings” and “cyborgs” in “smart cities”).
<strong>Concept:</strong> The Humanistic Intelligence Initiative will be an interdisciplinary and
cross-divisional research and collaboration initiative intended to invent, design,
develop, and deploy new technologies for the benefit of humanity and explore
complex questions around the boundaries between people, technology and the
environment in which they are situated. Housed within the Faculty of Applied
Science and Engineering (ECE, IBBME) and in collaboration with the Faculties of
Medicine, Business, Law, Information, and CAMH, the Initiative is intended to
galvanize research and innovation clusters throughout the University by providing
leadership, integrating opportunities for innovation and translation, reducing
duplication, and elevating the national and international profile of the University of
Toronto as the world’s epicentre for the ethical design, advocacy, and development
of technologies and technology standards that benefit humanity.
The Humanistic Intelligence Initiative is envisioned as a <strong>cross-divisional</strong> nexus for <strong>catalyzing ideas into innovations</strong>
by supporting the following ideals: <strong>knowledge mobilization</strong> (effectively translate research to advance technology
for humanity) and <strong>shared cross-divisional resources</strong> (to encourage collaboration and problem-based education);
and <strong>transdisciplinary approaches</strong> to “wicked” problems.</p>

<p><strong>Themes:</strong> The Initiative will support multidisciplinary and pan-institutional theme-driven clusters, partnerships and
projects. Three initial themes include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Technologies for empowering people: Providing all humans with the ability to leverage technologically
advanced tools to better themselves and society, e.g. cybersecurity, wearables, wearable medical records…;</li>
  <li>Collaborative problem-solving: establishing pan-disciplinary problem-based training opportunities to address
“wicked” social, political, ethical, and economic problems;</li>
  <li>Accelerating Invention &amp; Entrepreneurship: supporting entrepreneurship-focused innovation and inventions,
i.e. invention and entrepreneurship, technical standards societies, global policy initiatives, etc..</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of the themes will involve critical invention, responsible deployment, and human-centred advocacy. The
Initiative will accomplish this by creating new training programs and events, collaborations, outreach, and focusing
on partner driven themes in collaboration with other Initiatives.</p>

<h3 id="1-learning-teaching-and-training-events">1. Learning, Teaching, and Training Events:</h3>
<p>The team will first start by organizing brainstorming sessions where Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) from different
Faculty share their current research, and opportunities that can be applied to humanistic technologies. The results
of the conversations will lead to a series of related collaboration, training, and teaching programs, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hackathons</li>
  <li>Symposia &amp; conferences</li>
  <li>Training</li>
  <li>Workshops</li>
  <li>Seminars/Speaker Series</li>
  <li>Standards Organizations</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-invention-entrepreneurship-inventrepreneurship-nexus-for-health-well-being-and-personal-technology">2. Invention-Entrepreneurship (Inventrepreneurship) Nexus for Health, Well-Being, and Personal Technology:</h3>
<p>Healthcare is undergoing a transformation from centralized monolithic databases to distributed healthcare.
Individual patients take on a much more important role. We now wear our most up-to-date medical record!
Moreover, we propose an educational framework where students are encouraged to invent the future of
healthcare and bring new ventures to market, through translational research.</p>
<h3 id="3-collaboration-with-eces-inclusive-cybersecurity-network">3. Collaboration with ECE’s Inclusive Cybersecurity Network:</h3>
<p>Cybersecurity has traditionally been centralized but
new technologies like Internet of Things That Think (“smart technologies”) and wearables have made computing
and security everyone’s business, and thus we must think more inclusively in terms of cybersecurity. Security in
general has traditionally been done through surveillance and centralized monitoring, i.e. the powerful watching
the vulnerable. Things like health records used to be centralized on “secure” servers, but today, with wearable
technologies, our most up-to-date medical records are probably the recordings each of us make in our day-to-day
life. So we need a new way to look at cybersecurity that is not simply more surveillance. We propose an inclusive
cybersecurity network that empowers individuals to understand and audit their own personal safety.
In many cities there is a camera in every streetlight (“smart cities”) and also many washroom fixtures have
depth-cameras. Even the human eye itself can now act as a camera by recognizing brainwaves. The depth and
breadth of cybersecurity has greatly expanded from centralization to computing now in everyday things, and on
people (wearables), such as brain-scanning eyewear that captures what we see (rightmost above).</p>
<h3 id="4-collaboration-with-rotman-cdl-wearables-stream-for-health-and-well-being">4. Collaboration with Rotman CDL Wearables Stream for health and well-being:</h3>
<p>Southern Ontario (Toronto,
Hamiliton, Waterloo) has been, since the 1960s and 1970s, and continues to be, the world’s epicenter of wearable
computing and wearable technologies (“wearables”), and this will remain one of the themes. Rotman CDL
(Creative Destruction Lab) helped Thalmic Labs raise $120 million US, and now as North, valued at $199.6 million .
Toronto is also home of InteraXon, makers of the “Muse” brain-sensing headband, known widely as “The #1 in
wearables”. The proposed Rotman Wearables Stream would work synergistically with other themes.</p>
<h4 id="benefit-to-university-of-toronto">Benefit to University of Toronto:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Establishes the University of Toronto as the world leader in wearables, “Wearable AI”, and HI (Humanistic
Intelligence), and defining their technical, legal, ethical and security standards, and their public policy.</li>
  <li>Attract funding from industry partners to intensify wearables, HI, and Humanistic AI research at University of
Toronto.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="initial-collaborations">Initial Collaborations:</h4>
<p>The Initiative will generate numerous collaborative cross-faculty project topics. For
example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Quality-of-Sleep: Profs. Hill, Mann, and Yadollahi, on sleep studies with the Muse-S sleep band.</li>
  <li>Wearables and Mental Health: Profs. Griffiths, Mann, and Hill on accessibility to care for depression or anxiety
for patients that can’t find services in their area or afford treatments. Low-cost wearables will be used to
improve accessibility to care and provide for self-care (suicurity ) for suicide prevention; patients have control
over their own personal data recordings.</li>
  <li>Pandemic Preparedness: 20 years ago we started the pandemic preparedness and wearables DECONference™
series in collaboration with the McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology, and the ER-One project presented
on Capitol Hill in Washington DC. These collaborations will take on new urgency in the COVID-19 era where
we’re developing wearables and smart buildings + smart cities technologies for health monitoring.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="equity-diversity-and-inclusion">Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion</h3>
<p>HI Technologies are optimized to make the most of human differences, e.g. they
often help the visually impaired and others with unique needs . Whereas AI-based surveillance can often
discriminate, HI-based sousveillance (inverse surveillance) helps under-represented minorities have a voice and
retain control of their personal data. We will continue this work to assist vulnerable populations, including
Indigenous communities and enhancing accessibility technology. Consider, for example, a blind or visually
impaired user wearing a camera-based vision system being prohibited from entering a “no photography” building.
We need a way to guarantee “cyborg rights” to those who depend on technological prostheses. Our Initiative
must therefore directly address such issues as an always-on recording and memory aid and how it relates to
human rights, access rights, and how the rights of multiple “cyborgs” interplay with building owners, and others .
Wearables tend to “flatten” social hierarchy, and this flattening creates new legal and ethical frameworks .</p>
<h3 id="deep-humanity-ethical-legal-and-social-questions-on-equity-diversity-and-inclusion">Deep Humanity: Ethical, Legal, and Social Questions on Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion:</h3>
<h4 id="closet-cyborg">Closet Cyborg:</h4>
<p>Many people suffer from short-term memory impairments or from prosopagnosia (inability to see and understand
faces). To compensate for these disabilities, they (sometimes secretly) use technology to record and interpret
their surroundings (or to get help from others to do so). Should they keep this secret so they’re not physically
assaulted by police, security guards, and others for recording without permission (which is sometimes against
rules, laws, or social norms)? Or should they “come out” and get these rules, laws,
and social norms re-written?</p>
<h4 id="transhumanism-rights">Transhumanism Rights:</h4>
<p>A blind man wears a camera transmitting live video to his wife who speaks to him in his ear over a remote
connection to provide visual guidance. What washroom should he use (since his body is male but his sight is
female)? Should he hide his condition to avoid getting assaulted by guards or others? Or should he speak out and
fight for stalled gender-neutral washrooms, a social movement that already exists as part of the transgender
movement.</p>
<h4 id="bluebearer">Bluebearer:</h4>
<p>Your “Blueberry” eyeglass can sense if you’re sick, and also whether those around you are sick, by using wearable
miniature cameras and radar to remotely “read” their vital signs. Should you need to tell them you’re scanning
their health?
Smart People:
Smart buildings already “wear” hidden cameras to fight crime, and sometimes these are keep secret so that
criminals don’t circumvent them. Cars often have dashcams for investigative purposes. Now that technology is
getting miniaturized, it is only natural that people will get the same “rights” to wear sensing apparatus just like
buildings and cars do.</p>
<h4 id="smartwatch">Smartwatch:</h4>
<p>The Smartwatch was invented in 1998 at University of Toronto, and originally used for health and fitness tracking.
Today many companies are advancing the state-of-the art in smartwatches to track health and well-being. Can we
make an ultra low-cost health monitor cheap enough that nobody’s left behind?</p>
<h4 id="metavisiontm">MetavisionTM</h4>
<p>We have a right and responsibility to see and understand the technologies around us. Whereas manufacturers
want to keep the inner workings of their technology secret, there is a public and social interest in understanding
how the things around us work, such as the numerous hidden cameras in televisions, computers, thermostats,
light switches, toilets, and handwash faucets.</p>
<h4 id="no-cameras">No Cameras:</h4>
<p>With the Muse brain-sensing headband we are now able to “read” a person’s mind and see what they are looking
at. Therefore we can construct photographic images with “No Camera”, i.e. with the human eye itself as the
sensing device. As a form of social commentary and art intervention in favour of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion,
we have been keeping a collection of “No Cameras” signs recorded using “No Camera”.</p>
