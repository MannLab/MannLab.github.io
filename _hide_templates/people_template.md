# Please copy this format to create a new person entry on the site. People are sorted according to the 'Priority' stat below.
# Lower priority values mean higher listing (Steve is 1 for top priority).
# Please make sure to format the FILE NAME of the person as follows:
# First-Last.md
# If you fail to do so, the person may not appear, or may not be sorted to as it should be.
# Leave the layout tag as is. Write the quote for the employee in plain text below the line. It will be formatted automatically.
# To hide an employee who is not currently working, set "active" to false.
