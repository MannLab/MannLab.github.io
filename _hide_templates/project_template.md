# Please copy this format to create a new project entry on the site.
# Please make sure to format the FILE NAME of your project as follows:
# YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.md
# If you fail to do so, the project may not appear, or may not be sorted to as it should be.
# Leave the layout tag as is. Write the content for the project showcase in MARKDOWN below the line. It will be formatted automatically.
# Alternatively, you may write the page in HTML, though you should first contact the site administrator for styling guidelines.
# To feature a project, change its status from `complete` to `featured`. Any other status will not be rendered.
