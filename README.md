## Meeting Input

* Do we have a new job posting to reference? (todo items)
* Update the talent.pdf poster?
* What do we want in the footer?
* What info would we like to gather in a contact form?
* How would we like to go about populating the projects pages?
* What information do we want to put out publicly vs what do we want to keep close to our chest for CoVis development?
* Do we want to modify the front page to include any reference of news or project? If so how would we like to integrate that?
* Coming back around to thoughts on markdown content creation and Jekyll?
