# hii-uoft.github.io

## Todo

* Populate CoVis article
* Populate footer description
* Link social media
* Add photos
* Create News feed content
* Write up a Jam-with-us page (possibly with form entry for applying?)

## Proposals

* Form entry with resume upload on jam-with-us page
* Rename it from HII? Define the focus solidly
* Let's copy in some write-ups from previous projects to really populate the site, get people excited, show off what we have
* Place to link instructables?
