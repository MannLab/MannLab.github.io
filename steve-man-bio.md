Professor Steve Mann (PhD, MIT '97), widely regarded as the Father of Wearable Computing, is an inventor best known for his work in wearable computing, augmented reality, and the invention of HDR (high dynamic range) imaging which is used in nearly every digital camera and smartphone today, including the iPhone. Professor Mann and his team of world-class collaborators have built technology companies with a combined valuation of over $1 billion. </br>
Mann created the world's first wearable augmented reality computer in his childhood in 1974 to visualize electromagnetic radio waves, and has been building the field of phenomenological augmented reality for over 40 years, including the founding of the MIT wearable computing project as its first member, inventing the world's first smartwatch, the world's first contact-lens display, the first implantable eye camera, and the first underwater musical instrument (for which he coined the term Natural User Interface).  Mann is a tenured full professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto and General Chair of the IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society.
