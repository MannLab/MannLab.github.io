"Abstract — Meta-sensing (the sensing-of-sensing or sensing-ofsenses) with EEG (ElectroEncephaloGram) gamification forms the basis for a variety of games. to help with health and wellbeing for people of all abilities. First we develop a simple low-power ESP32-based Internet of Things (IoT) capture device for EEG and other data directly from devices such as the InteraXon MuseTMand Muse2TMor Neurosky MindwaveTM . The device eliminates the need to have a smartphone to use technologies like the Muse or Mindwave that otherwise require a smartphone. This makes technologies accessible to people who have challenges using smartphones, and also facilitates health care interventions and data logging in places such as retreats or spa facilities where cellphone use would be disruptive. Secondly, we create a series of games that encourage the development of assistive technologies. One such game is “MoBrainTM” which is a meditation competition based on mind-controlled motors, which we hope will lead to the development of wheelchair + mobility technologies for quadriplegics. Other games include “Mind FlowTM” or “MoFlowTM” in which brainwave-controlled water pumps provide increased flow when a player’s mind is in a state-of-flow, and “Mind’s EyeTM” in which we create games that cause the human eye to become a camera."
