# Making Sensors Tangible with Long-exposure Photography  

<http://wearcam.org/wearsys2019.pdf>  

"Abstract - We provide a simple way to make sensors (including wearable sensors) tangible. The result is a photographic depiction of sensing that is a form of photographic art, as well as scientific photography, allowing humans to easily see and understand sensors. Since photography is a preferable form of evidence, making sensors tangible may also have forensic value, e.g. allowing a judge or jury to be presented with photographic evidence of the efficacy or defects in sensors. We use robotics, digital video feedback, wireless communications, and long-exposure photography to see and understand smart city sensors and wearable camera systems in a new light."
