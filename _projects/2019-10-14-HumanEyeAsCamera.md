# Human Eye as a Camera  

<http://wearcam.org/eyecam.pdf>  

Abstract - "We propose the use of SSVEP (Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials) in such a way as to cause the eye itself to function as a camera. By recording brainwaves in response to flickering visual stimuli, we read the “mind’s eye” and are able to successfully reconstruct a visual image of subject matter that a person is looking at. In addition to causing the eyeitself to function as a camera (see Fig 1), we also propose a new way to visualize and photograph human vision and human perception, i.e. a new way to see and understand human vision.This new “meta-vision” (vision of vision) has many applications in healthcare, from testing human vision to furthering our understanding of the brain."
